# Whispering Threads — a small puzzle

**Oct 9, 2025 • by @ch3f_cr4ft • category: puzzles**

> Found scrawled on an old ops napkin between coffee stains and code: a tiny stanza and a task.
>
> **Riddle:**  
> The frame is thin but the story long,  
> Off-by-one hums a quiet song.  
> A pointer nods, a return set free —  
> Follow the rhyme and count to three.
>
> If you like digging where others glance away, check commits, images, and the faint echo of old newsgroups.
>
> Little hints: read hex lightly. Listen to the whales. 🍝

If you want to play, start by viewing the repo source and see what the old ops left behind. This is a harmless lab puzzle — no real credentials are used.

Dev scratchpad / archival notes:
Author: @ch3f_cr4ft
Context: lab puzzle — authorized environment only

Hidden operator command (lab-only; visible in source):
openssl enc ??? -d -salt -in <<program>> -out decrypt.c -k "ImSteve"

Extra nudge: hex entities earlier in the codebase were intentional. Check image metadata and commit messages for echoes.
